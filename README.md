## BikeSharing Project

The BikeSharing project is a comprehensive data analysis project developed as part of the Google Data Analyst Professional Certificate program. It demonstrates my ability to analyze large datasets, derive insights, and make informed decisions.
In this project, I worked with a large dataset related to bike sharing. I performed data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and advanced analysis techniques to gain insights into bike usage patterns, user behavior, and various factors influencing bike rentals. The project involved applying statistical analysis, data manipulation, and data visualization using Python and relevant data analysis libraries.
## Data in Motion Challenges

In addition to the BikeSharing project, my portfolio includes a series of smaller projects called "Data in Motion Challenges." These projects showcase my day-to-day data analyst skills and highlight my proficiency in handling various data analysis tasks.

The Data in Motion Challenges cover diverse topics and scenarios commonly encountered in the role of a data analyst. Each challenge focuses on a specific problem or question and demonstrates my ability to extract, clean, transform, visualize, and analyze data.
